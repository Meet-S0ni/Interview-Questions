Q-1 what is docker?
    
    - docker is a containerization software by which we can create containers
      for our application.

    Explain Docker Architecture

    - docker Architecture majorly contains three components
      docker client or docker cli
      docker daemon 
      docker registory

    - when user executes docker commands like docker run the docker client will
      send request to docker daemon 
    - after that to run our container docker daemon will first check the image on
      local repository if image is available than, it will run container from it
      if image is not available on  system than 
    - it will pull image from docker's public remote repository docker hub
      and run container
    - we can also pull image from privet repository 

    what is container
    
    - A container is a software package that contains everything 
      the software needs to run. 
      This includes the executable program as well 
      binaries, libraries, and settings.

    What is virtual Machines

    -

    What is containerization

    - containerization is a technology in which we are packaging binaries and libries to run our application
      

    What is virtualization

    - virtualization is a technology by which we can create multiple virtual machines in single physical machine.  

    what is difference between containerization and virtualization

    - in virtualization we are creating compleate virtual machine which has it's own virtual kernel, os and hardare
      but in containerization we are only virtualizing os

    what is docker image

    - Docker images are one kind of blue print for creating docker containers.
      

    What is docker hub

    - docker hub is a remote repository to store docker images 

    What is DockerFile

    - Dockerfile is a text file that contains the instruction to 

    what is docker engine
    what is network in docker
    what is volume in docker how to create it.

    - 

    Where the docker volumes are stored?
    how to mount any directory inside container
    
    - we can mount directory by using this command
      docker run --name=<name-of-container> -v <directory-on-host>:<directory-inside-container> <image>

    how to check container's IP address
    how to bind a port to a container
    how to enter into container  
    - we can enter using "docker commit" command or "docker exec" command 

    how to list running containers
    - we can list running containers using "docker ps" command
    
    how to list all containers running and stoped
    - we ca list all containers using "docker ps -a" command

    how to create docker container from docker image
    - we can run container using "docker run" command
      "#docker run --name=web <options> nginx"
