        QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
---------------------------------------


1. what is the use of FSTAB file?  OR what we will do to make mount point persistant?

   -> If we want to mount any filesystem or partition permenently then we will put entry into fstab file.
      there are 6 field in fstab file.
	1. Device Name
	2. Mount point
	3. type of filesystem
	4. mount options
	5. dummping
	6. check sequence of filesystem (fsck)
	
2. If you are getting any error or to check log which file you check?

   -> I will check "/var/log/messages" file and also check with "dmesg" command for specific error or keyword
	
3. what is udevd or udev ? 
 
   -> udev daemon is responsible for creating and removing entry from /dev file.
      e.g lets say we have created one partition so related file is getting created
	  inside /dev by udev daemon. 
      and when we delete/remove the partition or device it will remove entry from /dev.
   
4. what is daemon?
 
   Daemon is nothing but the "system Process" also called as service, 
   which generally runs in background.
   e.g. for ftp server daemon name is vsftpd, for ssh daemon is sshd, 
   for cron job daemon name is crond etc.
   
5. How to create filesystem or partitions?
 
	- 1st of all, I will create the partition using "fdsik" command e.g. fdisk /dev/sdb
	- Once partition is created, i will assign the filesystem by using mkfs.ext4 or mkfs.xfs
	- then i will create the mount point using mkdir command e.g. mkdir /data
	- finally, i will mount the filesystem using "mount" command 
	  e.g. mount <Device Name> <mount point> and to make it persistant
	  i will add entry into fstab file.
	  
6. What is major and minor Number? OR How Linux identify the device?
 
	Major Number:
	- All devices controlled by the same device driver have a common major device number. 
	  The major number is actually the offset into the kernel’s device driver table, which tells 
	  the kernel what kind of device it is. Each character and Block driver that registered 
	  with kernel has associated MAJOR number. 
	  There are total 256 [0-255] major number for character and block driver respectively.
													OR
	- Major number represent the actual device driver for block devices
	
	Minor Number:
	- The minor number tells the kernel special characteristics of the device to be accessed. 
	The minor number of the device node that represents the whole disk is 0. Minor Number is device “instance”. 
	The minor number is not used by kernel they are used by the driver only.
													OR
	- Minor number is partition of connection with block devices

7. What is Hard Link and Soft Link?

 
    Soft link is like a shortcut file, when we create a soft link it will assgin different inode to link file.
	whereas hardlink is like a backup file, when we create hard link, it will assign the same inode number to link file.
	soft link we can create between or across filesystem ( partition ) where as hardlink we can not.
	When we delete orignal file, then softlink will not be useful where as hard link we have data as its a (minor copy)copy/backup file.

8. use case of "rysnc", grep, AWK, sed, find, netstat, telnet, ssh, ping, traceroute/tracert, dd,dmesg command
 
	rsync:
			Rsync or Remote Sync, is a free command-line tool that lets you transfer files and directories
			to local and remote destination. Rsync is used for mirroring ,performing backups or 
			migrating data to other servers.

	grep: 
                  [Globle rregular expression print]
			The grep command is a filter that is used to search for lines matching a specified pattern and
			print the matching lines to standard output.

	awk:

			Awk is mostly used for pattern scanning and processing.
			It searches one or more files to see if they contain lines that matches with 
			the specified patterns and then perform the associated actions.

			In order to tell awk to use that file for its program, you type: awk -f source-file input-file1 input-file2 … 
			The -f instructs the awk utility to get the awk program from 
			the file source-file (see Command-Line Options). Any filename can be used for source-file .
			
			Unix provides sed and awk as two text processing utilities that work on a line-by-line basis. 
			The sed program (stream editor) works well with character-based processing, 
			and the awk program (Aho, Weinberger, Kernighan) works well with delimited field processing.

	sed:

			"sed" is a useful text processing feature of GNU/Linux. The full form of `sed` is Stream Editor. 
			Many types of simple and complicated text processing tasks can be done 
			very easily by using `sed` command. Any particular string in a text or a file can be searched, 
			replaced and deleted by using regular expression with `sed command. But 
			this commands performs all types of modification temporarily and the original file content is not 
			changed by default. The user can store the modified content into another file if needs.

	find:

			The find command is used to search and locate the list of files and directories 
			based on conditions you specify for files that match the arguments. 
			find command can be used in a variety of conditions like you can find files by permissions, 
			users, groups, file types, date, size, and other possible criteria

	netset:

			Netstat is a command line utility for Linux that prints network connections, 
			routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships. 
			Netstat can be used to diagnose network issues and service problems.

	telnet:

			In Linux, the telnet command is used to create a remote connection with 
			a system over a TCP (transmission control protocol)/IP network.
			It allows us to administrate other systems by the terminal. 
			We can run a program to conduct administration. It uses a TELNET protocol.

	ssh:
		
			ssh stands for “Secure Shell”. It is a protocol used to securely connect to a 
			remote server/system. ssh is secure in the sense that it transfers the data in encrypted 
			form between the host and the client. It transfers inputs from 
			the client to the host and relays back the output.

	ping:
		
			The ping command is a Command Prompt command used to test the ability of the source 
			computer to reach a specified destination computer. 
			It's usually used as a simple way to verify that a computer can communicate over 
			the network with another computer or network device.

	traceroute/tracert:

			Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to track in real-time 
			the pathway taken by a packet on an IP network from source to destination, 
			reporting the IP addresses of all the routers it pinged in between. 
			Traceroute also records the time taken for each hop the packet makes during its route to the destination.

	dd:
			dd is a command-line utility for Unix and Unix-like operating systems whose 
			primary purpose is to convert and copy files. On Unix, device drivers for hardware 
			(such as hard disk drives) and special device files (such as /dev/zero and /dev/random) 
			appear in the file system just like normal files.

	dmesg:
			dmesg command also called as “driver message” or “display message” is used to examine 
			the kernel ring buffer and print the message buffer of kernel. The output of 
			this command contains the messages produced by the device drivers.

			dmesg reads the messages generated by the kernel from the /proc/kmsg virtual file. 
			This file provides an interface to the kernel ring buffer and can be opened only by one process. 
			If syslog process is running on your system and you try to read the file with cat , 
			or less , the command will hang.

9. use of Important file "/etc/fstab", "/var/log/messages", /etc/sudoers

		The /etc/fstab file is one of the most important files in a Linux-based system, 
		since it stores static information about filesystems, their mountpoints and mount options. 
		In this tutorial we will learn to know its structure in details, 
		and the syntax we can use to specify each entry in the file.

		/var/log/messages – Contains global system messages, including the messages that are 
		logged during system startup. There are several things that are logged in 
		/var/log/messages including mail, cron, daemon, kern, auth, etc. a) /var/log/auth. ... 
		Using wtmp you can find out who is logged into the system.

		The /etc/sudoers file controls who can run what commands as what users on 
		what machines and can also control special things such as whether you need a password for particular commands. 
		The file is composed of aliases (basically variables) and user specifications (which control who can run what).
   
10. what is logrotation in linux?

		logrotate is designed to ease administration of system that generate large number og log files.
		it allows automatic rotation, compration, removel and mailing of log files. 
		each log file may be handled daily, weekly, monthly  or when it grows too large 
		normally logrotate is rum as a daily cron job.

11. How dose logrotation works in linux?

		The logrotate program is log file manager. it is used to regularly rotate log files 
		by removing the oldest ones frim your system and creating new log files. it may be 
		used to rotate based on the age of the file or the file size, and usually runs automatically
		through the cron utility.

12. What is ftp server?

		FTP server is a software Application , that is used the file transfer protocol
		to share the files over the internet between cliant and host machine,
		Here we have two machines,the end user , which islocal host machine and a destination,
		which is remote host.

13. What is nfs server

		Network file sharing (NFS) is a protocol that allows you to 
		share directories and files (storage) with other linux cliants ovr network.
		User add files to them, which are than shared with other users who have access to folder.
   
14. what is rsyslog?

		rsyslog is capable of forwording logs to remote servers the configuration is relatively
		smiple and makes it possible for linux admins to centralize log files for archiving and troubleshooting.

15. what is crontab?

		crontab is  a unix utility tat allows tasks to be automatically run in the background
		at regular intervals by the crond demon.

16. what is yum server?

		The yellowingdog updater, modifier(YUM) is open-sourse
		command line package mannage ment utility for linux operating system using the
		rpm package manager 
		Yum allows automatic updates, packages and dependancy 
		management on rpm based distributions

		SGID :

			-The setgid (set group id) is a permission bit ,that allows the user
			to execute a program with the permission of its group owner.

			-Setgid on a directory means that file created in the directory 
			inherate their group ownership from the directory, rahter than creatinng user.
			
			chmod g+s <directory_name> // for adding in symbolic mode //
			chmod g-s <directory_name> // for removing in symbolic mode //
			chmod 2766 <directory_name> // for adding in numaric mode //
			chmod 766 <directory_name> // for removing in numaric mode //

		find sgid available permission [ Serch sgid]
			# find / -perm -2000 #

			## to create new user and give password ##
					useradd <username> ; passwd <username>

			## To create new group ##
					groupadd <groupName> 

			## check available groups ##
					/etc/group where group is file
					cmd # cat /etc/group

		* To add user into group, the command is 
			usermod -aG <groupName> <username>

		* change group in file or dir
			chown <ownerName>:<groupName> <path or fileName>

		add sgid to user
			chmod 2775 /all [all is directory]

		2775 = sgid owner[rwx] group[rwx] other[r_x]

		## 
			create two users 
			create one group
			create one directory 
			add users in groups
			assign group to directory
			change permissions of directory to 2775

			now login with user1 and create 1 directory and 1 file 
			now login with user2 and create 1 directory and 1 file 

			modify user1's file while login from user2 
			modify user2's file while login from user1

		*STICKEY BIT
			
			-If the stickey bit is enabled on any directory , than directory 
			content can be deleted by its owner or root.

			#chmod +t <directory_name>    //for adding in symbolic mode // 
			#chmod -t <directory_name>    //for removing in symbolic mode //
